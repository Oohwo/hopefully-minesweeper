## Installation (Windows)
1) Download the zip and extract those files
2) We need to install Python. You can get the latest version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3) Open command prompt! This is where we'll be playing Minesweeper.
4) The script uses NumPy to create the Minesweeper box (a 2d-array). To install, type `py -m pip install numpy` 
5) Run `hopefully_minesweeper.py`

You can also open this in your preferred coding IDE and run the file.

## Roadmap
- [x] Made a scuffed version of Minesweeper
- [x] Cried a little bit
- [x] Drank boba
- [ ] Clear multiple empty-spaces at once (wow I'm excited for the math that'll go into here...)
- [ ] Artsy Welcome Menu B)
- [ ] Difficulty Menu (indecisive of custom rows, columns, and mines? we'll have a noob, casual, and pro difficulty!)
- [ ] Options Menu (cheats enabled)
- [ ] Arrow-keys to navigate (because who likes counting rows and columns?!)
- [ ] Potential YouTube video of the coding process (wouldn't that be funny?)
