# Hopefully Minesweeper

## Description
"Hopefully Minesweeper" is a Python script that allows you to play an extremely scuffed version of Minesweeper through your terminal. I coded this in Python for fun and to prepare for CS242 (Introduction to Data Science) which primarily uses Python. This project is still in the works but I hope to improve upon it! I've been playing Minesweeper for fun since my sophomore year of highschool so it was a lot of fun to try to code it myself!

## How to Play Minesweeper
1) Declare how many rows, columns, and mines you would like your board to have.
2) Input the space you would like to clear by (row,column), try not to hit any 'x's!
3) The numbers indicate how many mines are adjacent to the space. Use process of elimination to avoid the mines!
4) Good luck and have fun!

## Installation (Windows)
~~1) Download the zip and extract those files
~~2) We need to install Python. You can get the latest version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
~~3) Open command prompt! This is where we'll be playing Minesweeper.
4) The script uses NumPy to create the Minesweeper box (a 2d-array). To install, type `py -m pip install numpy` 
5) Run `hopefully_minesweeper.py`

You can also open this in your preferred coding IDE and run the file.

## Roadmap
- [x] Made a scuffed version of Minesweeper
- [x] Cried a little bit
- [x] Drank boba
- [ ] Clear multiple empty-spaces at once (wow I'm excited for the math that'll go into here...)
- [ ] Artsy Welcome Menu B)
- [ ] Difficulty Menu (indecisive of custom rows, columns, and mines? we'll have a noob, casual, and pro difficulty!)
- [ ] Options Menu (cheats enabled)
- [ ] Arrow-keys to navigate (because who likes counting rows and columns?!)
- [ ] Potential YouTube video of the coding process (wouldn't that be funny?)

## Credits
- Shoutout to [@potatomasqer](https://github.com/potatomasqer/python-game-projects/blob/master/minesweeper.py) for inspiring me to create my own Minesweeper in Terminal!
- Shoutout to Johnny who is the friend who got me to play Minesweeper in the first place! I forgot if we ever got sub-150 for expert mode on the app lol
- Karl Jobst for this cool [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V2kWCfzJVVU) on Minesweeper and the challenge
