# Hopefully Minesweeper
"Hopefully Minesweeper" is a Python script that allows you to play an extremely scuffed version of Minesweeper through your terminal.

## Demo

## Installation (Windows)
1) Download the zip and extract those files
2) We need to install Python. You can get the latest version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3) Open command prompt! This is where we'll be playing Minesweeper.
4) The script uses NumPy to create the Minesweeper box (a 2d-array). To install, type `py -m pip install numpy` 
5) `cd` into hopefully_minesweeper.py and run!
