"Hopefully Minesweeper" is a Python script that allows you to play an extremely scuffed version of Minesweeper through your terminal.

Blah blah blah I'll add a description here later

## Demo

## Installation (Windows)
1) Download the zip and extract those files
2) We need to install Python. You can get the latest version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
3) Open command prompt! This is where we'll be playing Minesweeper.
4) The script uses NumPy to create the Minesweeper box (a 2d-array). To install, type `py -m pip install numpy` 
5) Run `hopefully_minesweeper.py`

## Roadmap
- [] White-space functionality
- [] Arrow-keys to navigate
- [] lol potential YouTube video explaining the process of me creating it that would be funny
